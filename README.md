# Overview

{This software demonstrates the use of the Kotlin language in creating a Calculator app. In this program, I have used a while loop to handle the different user selections.
I have also demonstrated the use of the keyword "when" to handle the different mathematcial equations.}

{The purpose for writing this software is to demonstrate my understanding and ability to use the Kotlin language when creating programs.}
